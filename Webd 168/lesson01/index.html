<h1>My Bio</h1>

<p class="tab">
    My name is Jack but for some reason my friends prefer to call me by my last name: Travis. Coincidentally my father also prefers to be called Travis and I've even heard people refer to my brother as Travis. 
    I hail all the way from the land of Rhode Island and I have gone cross country at least twice although my memory betrays me. I've lived here in San Diego, California for about twelve years now and honestly It's an amazing medicine for my allergies.

    Currently I take ownership in a dog named <a href="dog.html"> Bailey</a> who is a 10 year old pure bred german shepherd with the heart of a puppy. Bailey fills maybe around 50% of my photo album on my phone so you know I'm obsessed with her.
    In my free time I play video games with some of my favorites being <i>Barotrauma</i>, <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, and <i>Wakfu</i> though currently as of Oct 2025 I am getting through the <i>Shadow of the Erdtree</i> DLC for <i>Elden Ring</i> (I know I am late).
    I also enjoy painting miniature models as well as random stuff to challenge me. One of the few random things I've done is set up a personal home server for my house although I don't quite know what to use it for now that I have it. Most i've used it for was to allow my friends and I to play some games together over the internet. 
    However I do plan on using it to store digital copies of movies I own so that I can watch them from anywhere the problem being is that I need additional hardware.

    I'm taking intermediate web design mostly for the fun of it. When I previously took the beginners course I found it kind of fun especially compared to the other coding courses I've taken such as Java and the little bit of C# I touched. 
    To be specific I've taken a couple of courses in Java though due to never using it I have mostly forgotten anything beyond the basics. Then for C# all my experience comes from a week in a high school computer science class.
    I'm excited to get a refresher on HTML and especially CSS as well as learn some new things too.
